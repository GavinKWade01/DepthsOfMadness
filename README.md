# DepthsOfMadness
Depths of Madness is a Deathmatch Quake level. 
The goal of this level is to create a varying heights with an underwater area to fight as well as the ground level. The ground level will have small changes in height to create a diverse map terrain. The underwater section will created an added depth to the map variation while keeping it in a relatively fast pace to keep the level entertaining.
